# Student Management System
This is a Spring Boot project for managing Students using REST API, PostgreSQL, Swagger UI, and JPA concepts.

## Overview

- **Spring Boot Project**: This project is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable architecture for managing Students.
